# DAA_LA_2_MINIMUM_NETWORK_COST_BUILDER
A Python-based project that builds a Minimum Cost Network using Kruskal’s Algorithm and Union-Find data structure. It finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), detects cycles efficiently, and visualizes network connections with total cost using NetworkX and Matplotlib.
Minimum Cost Network Builder

This project implements a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) generator using Kruskal’s Algorithm and the Union-Find (Disjoint Set) data structure. It efficiently constructs a minimum cost network by selecting the optimal set of edges that connect all nodes without forming cycles.

 Features:

Implements Kruskal’s Algorithm (Greedy approach)

Uses Union-Find for cycle detection and efficient edge selection

Visualizes the final network using NetworkX and Matplotlib

Displays total connection cost and selected edges

 Tech Stack:
Python, NetworkX, Matplotlib

Applications:
Used in network design, transportation systems, and infrastructure planning to minimize cost while maintaining full connectivity.
