# DAA_LA_2_MINIMUM_NETWORK_COST_BUILDER
A Python-based project that builds a Minimum Cost Network using Kruskal’s Algorithm and Union-Find data structure. It finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), detects cycles efficiently, and visualizes network connections with total cost using NetworkX and Matplotlib.
